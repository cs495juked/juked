# Juked
Collaborative song selection for any get together.

Juked is an application to give the power of music to the people. 
When a group of friends are together, the task of picking the music they listen to typically falls to one person. 
The host of a party or gathering can’t relax and enjoy their company because of the stress of constantly 
choosing music everyone will enjoy. Juked allows the host to share this responsibility by allowing the entire group 
to pick their favorite songs and vote on their friends’ choices so everyone gets to listen to music they like. 
Aside from making a party more interactive, the app also provides opportunity for people to venture out of their comfort zone.
It also possible for people to taste something new they were not aware of before, 
and prevents one person from monopolizing the party.

Juked will allow one phone to act as a host, and let anyone connected to that host’s lobby to 
choose the songs that will be played from the host phone. When the host creates a lobby, 
the app assigns it a four digit number from 0000 to 9999. The host can let the party goers know the generated lobby code. 
The guests then use that number to join the lobby. Every user gets to choose one song in a given  turn. 
Each guest may upvote or downvote any song in the queue and the top voted song goes to the top of the queue, 
while negative voted songs get pushed to the bottom (hence it is collaborative). If a song obtains a low enough score 
it is removed from the queue. If the host forgets to close out the lobby at the end of the party, the app’s back
end automatically closes the room after a certain amount of inactive time.
